# JOGOS DIGITAIS FINAL PROJECT

## Description

The idea behind this project is to develop a game using the pygame library. The game thematic should be related to helping disabled people on their rehabilitation process. 
The game have to be functional and integrate features that will help the health improvement of the player, using precision as an evaluation metric.


## Requirements

1. **Levels**: the game should have 3 distinct levels.
2. **Character**: the game should have at least one main character.
3. **Menu**: the game should have a main menu which allows the player to start, pause and restart the game.
4. **Precision and scoring**: during the game, the players precision should be tracked and used for measuring the score. The score can be used to evaluate the pacient's improvement throught the rehab process.
5. **Skateboard control**: the gaming control should be done by the movements of a skateboard simulator (since we don't have access to the skateboard simulator, the game's controll will be replaced with the keyboard arrows).
6. **Functionality**: the game should be functional, with all the proposed features working.
